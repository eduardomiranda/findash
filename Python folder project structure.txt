Designing an effective project structure is essential for both development and maintenance. A well-organized structure helps in understanding the project easily and enhances collaboration, especially in teams. Here's a proposed structure for a Python project within src/ and src/my_project/ directories. This layout assumes a somewhat generic project that might include a web component, some data processing, and a command-line interface (CLI), but it can be adapted based on your specific needs.

src/
├── my_project/
│   ├── __init__.py  # makes my_project a Python package
│   ├── main.py      # entry point for the project
│   ├── config.py    # configuration settings and env var management
│   ├── cli.py       # command-line interface handling, if applicable
│   │
│   ├── data/
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   ├── data_loader.py  # scripts to load data
│   │   └── data_processor.py  # scripts to process data
│   │
│   ├── database/
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   ├── models.py   # ORM models, if you're using an ORM like SQLAlchemy
│   │   └── connection.py  # database connection and session management
│   │
│   ├── services/
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   ├── user_service.py  # business logic related to user operations
│   │   └── invoice_service.py  # business logic for invoice operations
│   │
│   ├── utils/
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   ├── validators.py  # various data validation scripts
│   │   └── helpers.py  # helper functions used across the project
│   │
│   ├── web/
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   ├── app.py   # web application setup using a framework like Flask or Django
│   │   ├── views.py  # views/controllers for the web application
│   │   └── templates/  # if using a framework like Flask, HTML templates
│   │       └── base.html
│   │
│   └── tests/
│       ├── __init__.py
│       ├── conftest.py  # pytest fixtures that can be used across multiple test files
│       ├── test_data_loader.py
│       ├── test_data_processor.py
│       ├── test_user_service.py
│       └── test_invoice_service.py

└── setup.py  # setup script for installing the project/package. Use setuptools for this.

Key Components: 
	__init__.py: Makes Python treat directories as containing packages; this is somewhat optional in Python 3.3+ due to namespace packages, but it's still a good practice when you want to explicitly declare a package. 

	main.py: The entry point for executing the main logic of your project. This could be initiating a web server, starting a data processing job, etc. 

	config.py: Centralized configuration management. Could parse configuration files or environment variables and make them available to other parts of the application. 

	cli.py: For projects that have a command-line interface, this file would handle the parsing of command-line arguments and triggering the appropriate functionality. 

	data/: Contains scripts/modules for data loading and processing. 

	database/: Manages database connections, sessions, and ORM models (if using ORM).

	services/: Business logic is often stored here, separated from data access and presentation logic.

	utils/: Helper functions and utility code that doesn't neatly fit into other categories.

	web/: If the project includes a web component, this directory would include web application setup, routes, views, and templates. 

	tests/: Contains test cases and possibly test utilities and fixtures. Using a framework like pytest is recommended for testing Python applications. 

Additionally, you might want to include a .gitignore file for Git to ignore runtime files like .pyc or environment directories like .venv, and possibly a requirements.txt file (or Pipfile, if using pipenv) at the root for managing project dependencies.
